## üöÄ How to Use

1. Go to the **[Releases](https://github.com/penu01/warp-service-control/releases)** page of this repository.
2. Download the latest `WarpManager.exe` file.
3. Run it! That's all.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Antivirus False Positives

Some antivirus programs may flag the `WarpManager.exe` file as malicious. **This is a false positive.**

This happens because the application is created with PyInstaller, a tool that bundles Python code into a single executable. The way these executables work (unpacking files into a temporary folder to run) can sometimes resemble the behavior of malware, causing some antivirus heuristics to trigger a warning.

The project is fully open-source. You can review the code yourself to see that it is safe. For transparency, you can see a full VirusTotal scan report below, which indicates that the detection is based on the PyInstaller YARA rule and is not a sign of malware.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Build from Source

If you want to build the application yourself:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/penu01/warp-service-control.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```sh
    cd warp-service-control
    ```
3.  **Create a virtual environment and activate it:**
    ```sh
    python -m venv .venv
    .venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
4.  **Install the required build tool:**
    ```sh
